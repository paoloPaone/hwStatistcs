    <!-- Section 1: Basic Notions in Statistics -->
    <h2 class="section-title">Basic Notions in Statistics</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        In statistics, several fundamental concepts form the basis for analysis and interpretation of data. These include:
    </p>
    
    <!-- Subsection 1.1: Distributions -->
    <h3><strong>Distributions</strong></h3>
    <p>
        A <em>distribution</em> refers to the way values of a variable or a set of variables are spread or arranged. This distribution can be visualized through histograms, probability distributions, and density functions. Common types of distributions include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Normal Distribution:</strong> A symmetric, bell-shaped curve representing a dataset's frequency. It is characterized by its mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ), which determine the center and spread of the curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent experiments, each with the same probability of success.</li>
        <li><strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> Describes the probability of a given number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Subsection 1.2: Variables -->
    <h3><strong>Variables</strong></h3>
    <p>
        A <em>variable</em> in statistics represents an attribute or a quantity that can vary across different subjects in a study. Variables are categorized into two main types:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Categorical Variables:</strong> Qualitative variables that represent distinct groups or categories (e.g., gender, nationality).</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Quantitative Variables:</strong> Numeric variables that can be measured. They are further divided into:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discrete Variables:</strong> Variables that take on countable values (e.g., number of children).</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Variables:</strong> Variables that can take any value within a given range (e.g., temperature, height).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Subsection 1.3: Populations -->
    <h3><strong>Populations</strong></h3>
    <p>
        A <em>population</em> consists of all members or elements of a group being studied. Since it is often impractical to examine the entire population, statistical analysis typically focuses on a sample, which is a subset of the population.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Population Parameters:</strong> Quantitative measures that describe characteristics of the population, such as the population mean (µ) or population variance (σ²).</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Subsection 1.4: Statistical Units -->
    <h3><strong>Statistical Units</strong></h3>
    <p>
        A <em>statistical unit</em> is the individual element of the population that is being measured or observed. Each unit is distinct and represents a single entity in the analysis, such as a person, household, or company.
    </p>

<!-- Section 2: Notion of Average -->
<div class="container container-custom">
    <h2 class="section-title">The Notion of Average</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The <em>average</em> is a fundamental concept in statistics used to describe the central tendency of a set of data points. Common types of averages include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Mean:</strong> The sum of all values divided by the number of values. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:
            <br><br>
            <span class="math-formula">$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$</span>
            <br><br>
            where \( \bar{x} \) is the arithmetic mean, \( n \) is the number of observations, and \( x_i \) represents each individual value.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <!-- Section 3: Computational Problems -->
        <div class="container container-custom">
            <h3 class="section-title">Computational Problems in Averages</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        When calculating averages in large datasets or with high precision, several computational issues can arise:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Floating-Point Representation:</strong> Real numbers are stored with limited precision, which can lead to rounding errors during calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Catastrophic Cancellation:</strong> This occurs when subtracting two nearly equal numbers, leading to a loss of significant digits, and thereby reducing the accuracy of the result.</li>
                <li><strong>Numerical Stability:</strong> Algorithms must be designed to avoid magnifying small errors throughout calculations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

        <!-- Section 4: Knuth Recursive Formula -->
        <div class="container container-custom">
    <h2 class="section-title">Knuth Recursive Formula for Mean Calculation</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        A more stable approach to calculating the mean is the Knuth Recursive Formula. This method allows for updating the mean as new data points are added, avoiding floating-point errors:
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The recursive formula is expressed as:
        <br><br>
        <span class="math-formula">$$M_k = M_{k-1} + \frac{x_k - M_{k-1}}{k}$$</span>
        <br><br>
        Here, \( M_k \) represents the mean after including the k-th data point. This recursive method updates the mean incrementally, avoiding the need to recalculate the sum every time.
